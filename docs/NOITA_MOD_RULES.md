Noita - Modding Agreement

This modding agreement is a legally binding agreement between you and Nolla Games Oy, governing the creation and distribution of Mods relating to the video game ‘Noita’ (the Software). Mods are any derivate works, enhancements, modifications or adaptations that incorporate, interact or integrate with the Software (Mods).

If entering this Modding Agreement on behalf of a company, you warrant that you are authorised to bind the company to this agreement.

By creating or distributing any Mod, you accept these terms. If you do not accept these terms, you are not authorised to create or distribute any Mod.

You are still bound by possible End User Licence Agreement (EULA) of the Software, but these terms override the EULA where there is any inconsistency between the two agreements.

Mods

You may not create or distribute any Mod, or decompile or reverse engineer the Software, other than as expressly permitted in this Modding Agreement, or otherwise permitted by law that cannot be excluded by contract.

Mods are ONLY permitted with the Full/Paid Version of the Software.

Permission to Modify

Subject to the terms of this Modding Agreement, we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferrable, royalty-free licence to use, modify and adapt the content in the Software through the modding API, to create a Mod that adds new content, and distribute that Mod for non-commercial purposes.

We reserve the right to terminate this licence for any reason at any time by notice on our website or via email.

What this Means: Provided you comply with these terms, you may create and distribute Mods for the Software for non-commercial purposes.

Proprietary Rights

Nolla Games Oy retains ownership of, and reserves all rights in the Software. You own any Mods you create; to the extent they are distinct from the Software. No proprietary rights are assigned or transferred under this Modding Agreement.

You grant us an irrevocable, perpetual, royalty-free, non-exclusive licence to use, copy, modify, and adapt your Mod. Further, you irrevocably authorise us to distribute your Mod with the Software (attributing you as author), and grant corresponding sub-licences to end-users.

What this Means: We own the software. You own Mods you create. But as the two are designed to work together, and your Mods build upon our existing work, we also have the right to use, test and modify your mod, and distribute it for free with the Software.

Commercial Distribution Prohibited Without Consent

You may not sell, impose a fee, or distribute any mod for any commercial purpose, or in connection with any commercial enterprise, without our prior express consent in writing.

What this Means: If you want to sell, rent, or use your mod for any commercial purpose, you need our permission. Contact business@nollagames.com to discuss any other commercial options.

Software Assets

Mods may add to and enhance the Software, but you must not distribute a substantial part of our copyrightable code, content, assets or any other parts of the Software with the Mod. Mods may not contain any original or modified object files or binaries that are part of the Software.

What this Means: While Mods can change and patch the game they cannot distribute a substantial part of the original Software. Mods cannot distribute any binaries or object files that are part of the Software.

Restrictions on Mods

Unless otherwise permitted by law, Mods must not:

    Bring Nolla Games Oy or the Software into disrepute;

What this Means: You are entirely and solely responsible for your Mod. If anything in relation to your Mod causes any loss at all, that cost is on you, not us.

Severability
